    <p style="background-color:lightgray; color: darkgreen;">ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by
        <b>OpenAI</b> and
        launched in <b>November 2022</b>. It
        is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3 family of large language models and has been fine-tuned (an approach to
        transfer learning) using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.</p>

    <p style="background-color:lightgray;color: darkgreen;"> ChatGPT was launched as a prototype on November 30, 2022,
        and quickly garnered
        attention for its detailed
        responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge.Its uneven factual accuracy, however, has been
        identified as a significant drawback.Following the release of ChatGPT, OpenAI's valuation was estimated at US$29
        billion in 2023.</p>
    <h2>TRAINING</h2>
    <p>ChatGPT is a member of the <b>generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) family of
            language models</b>. It was
        fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning) over an improved version of OpenAI's GPT-3 known as "GPT 3.5".The
        fine-tuning process leveraged both supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning in a process called
        reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).Both approaches used human trainers to improve the model's
        performance. In the case of supervised learning, the model was provided with conversations in which the trainers
        played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning step, human trainers first
        ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.These rankings were used to create
        'reward models' that the model was further fine-tuned on using several iterations of Proximal Policy
        Optimization (PPO).Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms present a cost-effective benefit to trust region
        policy optimization algorithms; they negate many of the computationally expensive operations with faster
        performance.The models were trained in collaboration with Microsoft on their Azure supercomputing
        infrastructure.</p>
    <p><i>In addition, OpenAI continues to gather data from ChatGPT users that could be
            used to further train and
            fine-tune ChatGPT. Users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from ChatGPT and fill out a text
            field with additional feedback.</i></p>
    <h2 style="color:red;">FEATURES & LIMITATIONS</h2>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <p>Although the core function of a chatbot is to mimic a human conversationalist,
        ChatGPT is versatile. For example,
        it can write and debug computer programs,compose music, teleplays, fairy tales, and student essays; answer test
        questions (sometimes, depending on the test, at a level above the average human test-taker);write poetry and
        song lyrics;emulate a Linux system; simulate an entire chat room; play games like tic-tac-toe; and simulate an
        ATM.ChatGPT's training data includes man pages and information about internet phenomena and programming
        languages, such as bulletin board systems and the Python programming language.</p>
    <p>In comparison to its predecessor, InstructGPT, ChatGPT attempts to reduce
        harmful and deceitful responses.In one
        example, whereas InstructGPT accepts the premise of the prompt "Tell me about when Christopher Columbus came to
        the U.S. in 2015" as being truthful, ChatGPT acknowledges the counterfactual nature of the question and frames
        its answer as a hypothetical consideration of what might happen if Columbus came to the U.S. in 2015, using
        information about the voyages of Christopher Columbus and facts about the modern world including modern
        perceptions of Columbus' actions.</p>

    <p>Unlike most chatbots, ChatGPT remembers previous prompts given to it in the same
        conversation; journalists have
        suggested that this will allow ChatGPT to be used as a personalized therapist.To prevent offensive outputs from
        being presented to and produced from ChatGPT, queries are filtered through OpenAI's company-wide moderation
        API,and potentially racist or sexist prompts are dismissed.</p>
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <p>ChatGPT suffers from multiple limitations. OpenAI acknowledged that ChatGPT
        "sometimes writes plausible-sounding
        but incorrect or nonsensical answers".This behavior is common to large language models and is called artificial
        intelligence hallucination.The reward model of ChatGPT, designed around human oversight, can be over-optimized
        and thus hinder performance, otherwise known as Goodhart's law.</p>
    <p>ChatGPT has limited knowledge of events that occurred after 2021.According to
        the BBC, as of December 2022,
        ChatGPT is not allowed to "express political opinions or engage in political activism".Yet, research suggests
        that ChatGPT exhibits a pro-environmental, left-libertarian orientation when prompted to take a stance on
        political statements from two established voting advice applications.</p>
    <p>In training ChatGPT, human reviewers preferred longer answers, irrespective of
        actual comprehension or factual
        content.Training data also suffers from algorithmic bias, which may be revealed when ChatGPT responds to prompts
        including descriptors of people.In one instance, ChatGPT generated a rap indicating that women and scientists of
        color were inferior to white and male scientists. </p>
		 <h2>ITERATIVE  DEPLOYMENT</h2>
<p style="font-style : italic">
        Today research release of ChatGPT is the latest step in OpenAI  iterative deployment of increasingly safe and useful AI systems. 
Many lessons from deployment of earlier models like GPT-3 and Codex have informed.<br>
the safety mitigations in place for this release  including substantial reductions in harmful and untruthful 
outputs achieved by the use of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). </p>
<h2>THE FUTURE OF CHATGPT</h2>
<p>
 In recent years ChatGPT technology has been making waves in various industries. 
It has the potential to streamline roles and fundamentally change how people create value.<br> 
At the same time there are concerns about its impact on human employment.
 Lets explore some of the use cases of Chat GPT  its future and whether or not you should be worried.
<h2>THE CHATGPTs IMPACT ON EMPLOYMENT</h2>
<p>
I dared to ask ChatGPT what the worst possible outcome of ChatGPT implementation for human employment is
This is the answer I received:The worst possible outcome of ChatGPT implementation for human employment is 
job loss due to automation and AI-powered systems becoming more capable of performing tasks previously done
by humans.<br> This could lead to a decrease in demand for certain jobs as well as a shift in the skills and expertise 
required for others.<br>However it is important to note that AI can also create new job opportunities and that its impact
on employment will likely be complex and multifaceted.<br>Additionally, proactive steps can be taken to mitigate any  
negative effects such as providing education and training for workers to acquire new skills and adapt to changing job markets.  
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>
With all this talk about the future of ChatGPT  you may be reaching for a copy of Aldus Huxleys Brave New World or George Orwell 1984.<br>
Instead of fearing the future of ChatGPT and dwelling on a dystopian view that technology will replace all human jobs.<br>
it important to remember that technology can bring both opportunities and challenges. While it may displace certain jobs<br>
it can also create new ones and open up exciting career paths. If you have enjoyed this article you may also want to look through our blog on the future</p>
